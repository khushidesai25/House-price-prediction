# House-price-prediction
# üè† Housing Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts median housing prices in California using data from the 1990 census. This project uses both **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** models for regression analysis.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This project uses the `housing.csv` dataset to train and evaluate models that predict the **median house value** based on features like population, income, and location proximity to the ocean.

Key steps include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- One-hot encoding of categorical variables
- Training Linear Regression and Random Forest models
- Comparing model performances using RMSE and R¬≤ score
